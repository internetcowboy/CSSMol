CSSMol
===

A port of the excellent [CanvasMol](http://alteredqualia.com/canvasmol/) from canvas to CSS 3D Transforms.
Please do notice that Branislav of [alteredqualia](http://alteredqualia.com/canvasmol/) is the real brainy workhorse behind this - we've only ported it and put on some lipstick, though the spherical coordinates did take some repetition of our linear algebra skills.
The molecules at display are publicly availble and originate from PDB and Pubchem.

For everyone who is overly impatient: [demo](http://79.99.1.153/cssmol/)
Try running it on your iPhone / iPad and add it to your homescreen.
You can also try it out in Safari 4 / Webkit nightly (on Mac at least).


Why would anyone do this, you ask?
Well, we needed an excuse to play with the cutting edge CSS 3D Transforms, so why not?
Mind the cutting edge-ness though - this is so new that probably only Mobile Safari, Safari 4 and Webkit Nightly supports it.
So why do it then? Well, because Mobile Safari has hardware accelerated CSS Transforms - meaning we can get decent performance even on a small weak device as the iPhone.
