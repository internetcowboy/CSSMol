CSSMol
===

A port of the excellent [CanvasMol](http://alteredqualia.com/canvasmol/) from canvas to CSS 3D Transforms.

Why would anyone do that, you ask?
Well, we needed an excuse to play with the cutting edge CSS 3D Transforms, so why not?
Mind the cutting edge-ness though - this is so new that probably only Mobile Safari, Safari 4 and Webkit Nightly supports it.
So why do it then? Well, because Mobile Safari has hardware accelerated CSS Transforms - meaning we can get decent performance even on a small weak device as the iPhone.
